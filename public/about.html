<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Maelyn Hunting. I have recently began learning how to code and become a web developer. 
  I was a hairstylist for 6 years and I really enjoyed it, but I have decided that I want to try something new. 
  I have always been interestd in technology and web development so I thought it would be fun to give this a try.
  </p>
  <p>I am hoping that this career will allow me to work from home and be able to spend more time with my family.
    I've been married to my husband Liam for almost 10 years and we have two daughters, Claire, who is 8, and Addie, who is 4.
    In my free time I enjoy reading, listening to true crime and horror podcasts, watching movies, spending time outside, 
    and being with my family.
  </p>
 <p>I am excited to learn more about web development and I hope to be able to create my own website one day. 
  I am looking forward to learning more about coding, how to make websites more interactive and user friendly, 
  and learning more about web design and how to make websites visually appealing.
  I am excited to see where this journey takes me and I hope to be able to use my skills to help others in the future. 
  Thank you for taking the time to read about me and I hope you enjoy my portfolio!
